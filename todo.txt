[X] Make library modules add themselves to Libraries["Module"]
[X] Move library building-stuff to the Library-modules themselves
[ ] Add Require("OtherLibrary") in framework.lua for use in the
    Library-modules.
[ ] Project files should be simpler and not require create-stuff 
    for both debug and release builds
